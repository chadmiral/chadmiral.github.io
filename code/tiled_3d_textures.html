Hey, you know what's kind of tricky? Creating a 3D texture that seamlessly tiles on all three axes. A naive approach might be to
cross-fade a 3D texture along the edges

* crossfade method
* mirror method
* 4D torus method for 

				//wrap our cube around the surface a 4D torus to make the sampling tileable
				float w = (4.0f + (2.0f + cos(a)) * cos(b)) * cos(c);
				float x = (4.0f + (2.0f + cos(a)) * cos(b)) * sin(c);
				float y = (2.0f + cos(a)) * sin(b);
				float z = sin(a);
