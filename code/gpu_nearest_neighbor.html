  <h1>GPUNearestNeighbor</h1>
  Lately I've been fascinated with Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations and
  nearest-neighbor searches. I was working on a project that required fast "nearest
  neighbor" queries for a point cloud on the surface of the unit sphere, and
  came up with a method to leverage the GPU.
  <p>
  <h2>Method 1: KD-Trees on the CPU</h2>
  My first thought was to build a
  <a href = "http://www.alglib.net/other/nearestneighbors.php">KD-tree</a> and
  query it every frame. This worked well enough, but it was actually pretty slow
  in my case because the point cloud moved every frame, and thus had to be rebuilt.
  This resulted in O(nlogn) tree-building time and O(logn) queries.
  <p>
  I realized that if I was willing to sacrifice a little bit of accuracy, I could
  perform a very specialized approximate nearest-neighbor search on the surface
  of the sphere.

  <h2>Method 2: Rendering cones to an offscreen texture</h2>
  I was messing around in Blender and realized that by rendering a set of
  intersecting cone, when viewed top down with an orthographic projection,
  the result is the 2D voronoi diagram defined by the points of the cones.
  <p>

  <div id="footnote">fig. 1</div>
  <p>
  For our method, we simply need to collect a list of sites and render
  a right-angled cone at each site, using the color channel to encode the site
  index.
  <p>
  To ensure high-fidelity, we choose the highest resolution depth buffer available
  and set a very tight depth range to prevent depth-related artifacts. It is also
  important to disable texture filtering on our render target, as any blurring
  of the pixels would give us incorrect results for the query.
  <p>

  <p>
  To avoid GPU stalls, we then copy the texture once per frame into system
  memory so that we may make as many queries as we want without involving the GPU.
  <div id="footnote">
    fig. 2<br>
    The index of the site is encoded into the color of each cell.
  </div>
  The query function is simple. We take as input a 2D point in polar coordinates
  and convert that into an index into our texture array (which now lives in sytem
  memory.)

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  The cone rendering loop could be optimized greatly by reducing the number of
  draw calls. Rather than rendering each cone with a single draw call, I should
  be building a huge draw call with all my cones.
  <p>
  Currently the code doesn't support wrapping along the longitudinal axis, so
  there will be a "seam" along <i><b>(0, v)</b></i>. This is easily fixed by rendering the cones
  that intersect the seam twice (offset by a unit to the left or right)
