      <h1>The Problem: Fast Nearest-Neighbor Queries on the Unit Sphere</h1>
      <p>
      While working on <a href="mundus.html">Mundus()</a> I needed a method to
      quickly find the nearest site in an irregular grid on the surface of a
      sphere to an input position.<p>
      My first thought was to build a
      <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">KD-tree</a> and
      query it every frame. This worked well enough, but it was actually pretty slow
      in my case because the point cloud moved every frame, and thus had to be rebuilt.
      This resulted in O(nlogn) tree-building time and O(logn) queries.
      <p>
      I realized that if I was willing to sacrifice a little bit of accuracy, I could
      perform a very specialized approximate nearest-neighbor search on the surface
      of the sphere.
      <p>
      <h1>The Solution: Render a Bunch of Cones... wait... what?!</h1><p>
      It turns out that if you render a right-angled cone at the location of
      each of the sites in a 2D point cloud, and view it from the top with an orthographic projection,
      you have actually built an approximate Voronoi diagram.<p>
      <p>

        <div class="footnote">
          (fig. 1)<br>
          Color encoded flat-shaded cones create a
          voronoi diagram when viewed orthographically from above.
        </div>
      </center>
      <p>
      For our method, we simply need to collect a list of sites and render
      a right-angled cone at each site, using each cone's color to encode the site
      index.
      <p>
      We use a BGRA format for the render texture, as we don't want to waste
      any processing time in converting color formats. We will also want to turn
      off any texture filtering on the render texture so that we don't get blurred
      borders between voronoi cells (which would introduce error)
      <center>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/chadmiral/9fb3341b5ca867e7574a.js"></script>
      </center>
      <p>
      To ensure high-fidelity, we choose the highest resolution depth buffer available
      and set a very tight depth range to prevent depth-related artifacts.
      <p>
      After rendering the cones to an offscreen texture, we get a result like this.
      Each shade of red represents an index into the array of site positions. We
      combine the RGB channels while querying to allow for up to 16.7 million
      (256<sup>3</sup>) site locations. (Utilizing the alpha channel would
      allow 256<sup>4</sup>.)<br>
      To query the nearest neighbor to a point <i><b>(&theta;, &phi;)</b></i>, we need
      only treat the input as <i><b>(u,v)</b></i> coordinates and sample the
      texture.

          </i>
        </div>
      </center>
      <p>
      To avoid GPU stalls, we then copy the texture once per frame into system
      memory so that we may make as many queries as we want without involving the GPU.
      This can be further optimized by using a double pixel-buffer that can be
      filled asynchronously.<p>

      <p>
      Putting it all together, we use the following function to render our set
      of cones to a frame buffer texture.
      <center><script src="https://gist.github.com/chadmiral/46d1548c375d5f4aeee3.js"></script></center>
      <p>
      The query function is simple. We take as input a 2D point in polar coordinates
      and convert that into an index into our texture array (which now lives in sytem
      memory.)
      <p>

      <h1>Accuracy</h1><p>
      This is an <i>approximate</i> method, and the accuracy is a product of the
      resolution used in the render texture, the bit-depth of the depth buffer
      and the number of segments use to render the cones.
      </thead>
      <h1>Future Work</h1><p>
      The cone rendering loop could be optimized greatly by reducing the number of
      draw calls. Rather than executing a draw call per cone, we should instead
      fill a single draw call with as many cones as possible.
      <p>
      Currently the code doesn't support wrapping along the longitudinal axis, so
      there will be a "seam" along <i><b>(0, v)</b></i>. This is easily fixed by rendering the cones
      that intersect the seam twice (offset by a unit to the left or right)
