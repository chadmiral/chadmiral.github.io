  <title>Chandra Foxglove - Dinosaur Aficionado, Extraordinaire</title>
  <h1>Chandra Foxglove</h1><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Mundus - a planet simulator complete with plate tectonics simulation. (WIP)
  <li>GPUNearestNeighbor - a fast GPU-based method to find approximate nearest neighbors on the surface of a sphere.
  <li>GPUHair - a fast GPU-based physics simulation for hair.
  <li>2D Fluid Simulator - a CPU-based real time fluid simulator.
  <li>Grootling - a half baked arduino project to measure a house plant’s moisture levels and to tweet when it needs watering
  <li>Gameboy Emulator - A 1:1 implementation of the original Gameboy’s instruction set.
  <li>Gameboy Advance Homebrew - I wrote a sprite-based Japanese language flashcard “app”.
  <li>Dreamcast Homebrew - The original dreamcast was fairly easy to hack into a devkit, so of course that’s what I did. My first experience programming for game consoles was trying to make sense of the Dreamcast’s tile-based rendering hardware..
  <li>ChaOS - a terrible operating system that immediately kernel panics after counting the system memory (ix86 assembly language)
  </ul>
